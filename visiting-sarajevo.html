</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>My BlaBlaCar ride <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> to Sarajevo was a very pleasant experience.  My driver
was really nice, we talked a lot, and he explained my the different places
while we were passing by.  I loved the experience of entering Bosnia when
suddenly the whole landscape looks different, with lots of hills and forests.</p>

<p>We then arrived in the early afternoon in Sarajevo.  Quite early during my
&quot;Tour de Hackerspace&quot; <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/czesiekhaker">Czesiek</a>, a close friend of <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/andrewhobden">hoverbear</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/NGC_3572">thomascovenant</a>, offered <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/czesiekhaker/status/852902273189634049">via Twitter</a> to show me around Sarajevo when I get
there for a visit, which I found quite amazing!  So I arranged with him to
couch surf at his place and meet him there in the evening.</p>
<p>Since I had the whole afternoon to explore the city I decided to store my
luggage in a nearby hostel and wander around the old town of the city.  I had
some of the <a class="reference external" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bosnian+coffee&amp;yeg=B&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images">Bosnian coffee</a> and tried the Ćevapi for late lunch.</p>

<p class="caption">Sarajevo old town</p>

<p>At some point during the afternoon I noticed, that I forgot my Ferris plushie
in the BlaBlaCar!  So I contacted the driver again and we arranged to meet the
next day in the morning.</p>
<p>In the evening I met with Czesiek and after placing my luggage in his flat, we
proceeded to go to a micro brewery to get some of the local beer.  Afterwards
we went to a few other places and at one place ended up meeting some Australian
guys I've seen earlier in the afternoon in the old town.  I always love meeting
other people who are travelling because they are most of the time easy going
and have some interesting stories to tell.</p>

<p class="caption">Sarajevo during the night</p>

<p>We ended up having lots of fun this night which lead to me having a very hard
time getting up at 8:00 to retrieve my Ferris.  But it amazed me how when
meeting other hackers during my trip I feel connected to them instantly like we
were knowing each others for years.</p>
<p>Since the weather was just too nice, I spent the next day visiting the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23723340">Bijela
tabija castle</a> where one has a nice view over the city.  During my way up I
also enjoyed exploring this part of the city which consist of many small
streets and alleyways.</p>

<p>In the evening we had again lots of fun, this time visiting a sisha bar /
hookah lounge where there was some live music.  In the mean time I found out,
that the hackerspace which is mentioned in the hackerspace wiki probably
doesn't exist.  So during the evening I talked with Czesiek and his friends
about founding one in Sarajevo.</p>
<p>The next day I slept in and then met with Czesiek for lunch and then proceeded
to visit his workplace in Sarajevo.  He works for the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.occrp.org/index.php">Organized Crime And
Corruption Reporting Project</a> (OCCRP), which does a great job supporting
investigative journalism all over the world.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_occrp_office.jpg"><img alt="Door to Czesieks office in the OCCRP place" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_occrp_office.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Door to Czesieks office in the OCCRP place</p>
</div>
<p>Since I wanted to avoid taking pictures of any sensitive material I just took a
picture of the door to the office ;)</p>
<p>Czesiek self described his work as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
I'm a hacker at OCCRP, I'm in charge of developing editorial pipeline
(newsroom software geared towards investigative journalist teams; we plan
to opensource it after internal testing) and digital security.</blockquote>
<p>After my short visit, I proceeded to verify if the hackerspace in Sarajevo
exists or not.  When arriving at the place it's supposed to be I found an
interesting technology hub called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hub387.com/">HUB387</a>.  Nobody there heard about a
hackerspace, so I changed the wiki entry to reflect that.  Because I was
already there and had no other plans, I rented a desk at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nest71.com/">NEST71</a>
coworking space for 10€ and spent some time working on this blog post.</p>
<p>In the evening there was a party at Czesieks house and I had the pleasure to
meet more of the OCCRP crew and other interesting people.  I enjoyed the fact,
that we consisted of people from 7 different nations (Polish, French, Bosnian,
Mexican, American, British and Swiss)!</p>
<p>Despite of having some slight trouble getting up on Saturday morning, Czesiek
and I attended a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mreza-mira.net/vijesti/razno/lgbti-zajednica-odrzala-lekciju-vlastima/">protest</a> against violence against LGBT people.  It was a
very peaceful and somewhat cheerful event.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%">

</div>
<p>After the protest we went for some coffee and I had the opportunity to meet
interesting people including a German guy who works for the European embassy.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I visited the <a class="reference external" href="http://museum.warchildhood.com/">War Childhood Museum</a>.  It was a very heart
touching experience, reading the stories of how children were experiencing the
war.  Also still after more than 20 years, marks of the war are still visible
in Sarajevo.</p>
<p>In the evening we went to the after party of the protest and again I met some
amazing people amongst others Emina Bošnjak from the <a class="reference external" href="http://soc.ba/en/about-us/team/">Sarajevo Open Centre</a>.</p>
<p>The next day I had a BlaBlaCar booked for the early afternoon, so we had bearly
enough time to go up to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebević">Trebević</a>, enjoy the view and walk the way down.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%">

<p>I really loved my stay in Sarajevo.  Czesiek is an awesome host and I can
highly recommend to stay with him if you are in Sarajevo ;)</p>
<p>However, next stop: Zagreb, Croatia!</p>
