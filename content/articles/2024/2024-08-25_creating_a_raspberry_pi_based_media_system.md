Summary: Setting up a media system on a Raspberry Pi 3 based on ArchLinux ARM, snapcast and mopidy
Status: draft

For quite some time I wanted to setup a Raspberry Pi based sound system with
which I could do the following:

 * Directly connect speakers to it
 * Stream audio from various sources
 * Connect a small USB based sound mixer
 * Run spotifyd
 * Play music from my NAS

# Resources

Researching a bit I found the following interesting resources

   * <https://hifiberry.com/>
   * <https://volumio.com/>
   * <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast>
   * <https://mopidy.com/>
   * <http://techroadtrip.com/audio-software/volumio-vs-moode-vs-picoreplayer/>
   * <https://www.runeaudio.com/>
   * <https://github.com/dbrgn/weltempfaenger/>


# Hardware

For the hardware I settled for

 * A Raspberry Pi 3 which I had laying around anyway
 * [HiFiBerry Amp2](https://www.hifiberry.com/shop/boards/hifiberry-amp2/)
   which looked very promising and wasn't too expensive

# Software

The first thing I tried was [volumio](https://volumio.com/), which directly
offers a convenient Raspberry Pi image which gets you started quickly:
<https://volumio.com/get-started/>.

While it was very convenient to get started and verify that the amplifier
works, it seemed to me that the free version is very limited and locked down.
Also the premium price with 80$ (around 70 CHF) per year seemed a bit expensive
to me.

Since I wanted something which lets me tinker around a bit more I came up with
the following options:

 * [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/)
 * [ArchLinuxARM](https://archlinuxarm.org/)

While buildroot would probably allow to get a much more minimal system and a
friend of mine had a good experience using it for [his
project](https://github.com/dbrgn/weltempfaenger), the guide I found for
[setting up
snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapos/blob/master/buildroot-external/README.md)
seemed out of date and not maintained anymore.
Also I already know ArchLinux and used ArchLinuxARM for my [kodi
system](https://blog.rnstlr.ch/installing-archlinux-arm-on-the-raspberry-pi-3.html).

## Installing ArchLinux ARM


<details>
<summary>So I followed the basic install guide.</summary>

</details>

I then changed the hostname to avoid the conflict with my existing archlinuxarm
machine in the network and rebooted:
```text
[root@alarmpi alarm]# hostnamectl hostname muzikskatolo
[root@alarmpi alarm]# reboot
```

## Setting up the network

To get wifi running I installed `iwd`:
```text
[root@muzikskatolo alarm]# pacman -S iwd
[root@muzikskatolo alarm]# systemctl enable iwd.service
[root@muzikskatolo alarm]# systemctl start iwd.service
```

Then connected to my wifi

```text
[root@muzikskatolo alarm]# iwctl
NetworkConfigurationEnabled: disabled
StateDirectory: /var/lib/iwd
Version: 2.19
[iwd]# station wlan0 scan
[iwd]# station wlan0 connect wifi-ssid
Type the network passphrase for wifi-ssid psk.
Passphrase:
```

And configured systemd to start DHCP for the interface by creating
`/etc/systemd/network/wlan0.network` with the following content:

```conf
[Match]
Name=wlan0

[Network]
DHCP=yes
IgnoreCarrierLoss=3s
```

Followed by

```text
[root@muzikskatolo alarm]# systemctl reload systemd-networkd.service
```

Also I disabled waiting for all networks to be online, since the Pi will only
have wifi were I want to place it:

```text
[root@muzikskatolo alarm]# systemctl disable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
[root@muzikskatolo alarm]# systemctl enable systemd-networkd-wait-online@wlan0.service
```

## Enabling the Audio

To get the amp running I enabled the `hifiberry-dacplus` `dtoverlay`:

```ini
# https://www.hifiberry.com/docs/data-sheets/datasheet-amp2/
dtoverlay=hifiberry-dacplus,slave
```

For the next step I powered down and hooked up the Raspberry Pi to the
hardware.

## Configuring Audio

To be able to test I needed to add the `alarm` user to the `audio` group:

```
sudo usermod -G audio -a alarm
```

Then I used `aplay -l` to find out which device got which card index:

```text
$ aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: vc4hdmi [vc4-hdmi], device 0: MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0 [MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: sndrpihifiberry [snd_rpi_hifiberry_dacplus], device 0: HiFiBerry DAC+ HiFi pcm512x-hifi-0 [HiFiBerry DAC+ HiFi pcm512x-hifi-0]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

To route audio by default to the hifiberry device I configured alsa to use
card-1 by default I created `/etc/alsa/conf.d/default.conf` with the following
content ([^1]):

```
defaults.pcm.card 1
defaults.ctl.card 1
```

Then I used `speaker-test` to test the speakers

```
$ speaker-test -c 2

speaker-test 1.2.12

Playback device is default
Stream parameters are 48000Hz, S16_LE, 2 channels
Using 16 octaves of pink noise
Rate set to 48000Hz (requested 48000Hz)
Buffer size range from 8 to 131072
Period size range from 4 to 65536
Periods = 4
was set period_size = 12000
was set buffer_size = 48000
 0 - Front Left
 1 - Front Right
Time per period = 5.007955
 0 - Front Left
 1 - Front Right
```

After connecting my USB audio device I noticed, that the indices of the sound
cards changed:

```text
$ aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: vc4hdmi [vc4-hdmi], device 0: MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0 [MAI PCM i2s-hifi-0]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: CODEC [USB AUDIO  CODEC], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 2: sndrpihifiberry [snd_rpi_hifiberry_dacplus], device 0: HiFiBerry DAC+ HiFi pcm512x-hifi-0 [HiFiBerry DAC+ HiFi pcm512x-hifi-0]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

So to get around that I switched the configuration to use the name of the card.
For that we need to use a slightly different syntax:

```
pcm.!default {
	type hw
	card sndrpihifiberry
}

ctl.!default {
	type hw
	card sndrpihifiberry
}
```

### Notes

 * Playing back line in: `alsaloop -C hw:1,0 -P hw:2,0`
