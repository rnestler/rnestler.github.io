</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My BlaBlaCar ride &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; to Sarajevo was a very pleasant experience.  My driver
was really nice, we talked a lot, and he explained my the different places
while we were passing by.  I loved the experience of entering Bosnia when
suddenly the whole landscape looks different, with lots of hills and forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;View during a break on the car ride&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then arrived in the early afternoon in Sarajevo.  Quite early during my
&amp;quot;Tour de Hackerspace&amp;quot; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/czesiekhaker"&gt;czesiek&lt;/a&gt;, a close friend of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/andrewhobden"&gt;hoverbear&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/NGC_3572"&gt;thomascovenant&lt;/a&gt;, offered &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/czesiekhaker/status/852902273189634049"&gt;via Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to show me around Sarajevo when I get
there for a visit, which I found quite amazing!  So I arranged with him to
couch surf at his place and meet him there in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had the whole afternoon to explore the city I decided to store my
luggage in a nearby hostel and wander around the old town of the city.  I had
some of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bosnian+coffee&amp;amp;yeg=B&amp;amp;iax=1&amp;amp;ia=images"&gt;Bosnian coffee&lt;/a&gt; and tried the Ćevapi for late lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_city_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sarajevo old town" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_city_2.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Sarajevo old town&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point during the afternoon I noticed that I forgot my Ferris plushie in
the BlaBlaCar!  So I contacted the driver again and we arranged to meet the
next day in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening I met with czesiek and after placing my luggage in his flat, we
proceeded to go to a micro brewery to get some of the local beer.  Afterwards
we went to a few other places and at one of them ended up meeting some Australian
guys I've seen earlier in the afternoon in the old town.  I always love meeting
other people who are travelling because they are most of the time easy going
and have some interesting stories to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_city_6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sarajevo during the night" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_city_6.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Sarajevo during the night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up having lots of fun this night which lead to me having a very hard
time getting up at 8:00 to retrieve my Ferris.  But it amazed me how when
meeting other hackers during my trip I feel connected to them instantly as if
we knew each others for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the weather was just too nice, I spent the next day visiting the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23723340"&gt;Bijela
Tabija castle&lt;/a&gt; where one has a nice view over the city.  During my way up I
also enjoyed exploring this part of the city which consist of many small
streets and alleyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_city_8.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="On my way to Bijela Tabija" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_city_8.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;On my way to Bijela Tabija&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_city_14.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ruins of the Bijela Tabija castle" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_city_14.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Ruins of the Bijela Tabija castle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_city_17.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="View over Sarajevo" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_city_17.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;View over Sarajevo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we had again lots of fun, this time visiting a shisha bar /
hookah lounge where there was some live music.  In the meantime I found out,
that the hackerspace which is mentioned in the HackerspaceWiki probably
doesn't exist.  So during the evening I talked with czesiek and his friends
about founding one in Sarajevo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I slept in, met with czesiek for lunch and then proceeded
to visit his workplace in Sarajevo.  He works for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.occrp.org/index.php"&gt;Organized Crime and
Corruption Reporting Project&lt;/a&gt; (OCCRP), which does a great job supporting
investigative journalism all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_occrp_office.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Door to czesiek's office in the OCCRP place" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_occrp_office.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Door to czesiek's office in the OCCRP place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wanted to avoid taking pictures of any sensitive material I just took a
picture of the door to the office. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;czesiek described his work as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I'm a hacker at OCCRP, I'm in charge of developing editorial pipeline
(newsroom software geared towards investigative journalist teams; we plan
to opensource it after internal testing) and digital security.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my short visit, I proceeded to verify if the hackerspace in Sarajevo
exists or not.  When arriving at the place it's supposed to be I found an
interesting technology hub called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hub387.com/"&gt;HUB387&lt;/a&gt;.  Nobody there heard about a
hackerspace, so I changed the wiki entry to reflect that.  Because I was
already there and had no other plans, I rented a desk at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nest71.com/"&gt;NEST71&lt;/a&gt;
coworking space for €10 and spent some time working on this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening there was a party at czesiek's house and I had the pleasure to
meet more of the OCCRP crew and other interesting people.  I enjoyed the fact
that our group consisted of people from 7 different nations (Polish, French,
Bosnian, Mexican, American, British and Swiss)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite of having some slight trouble getting up on Saturday morning, czesiek
and I attended a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mreza-mira.net/vijesti/razno/lgbti-zajednica-odrzala-lekciju-vlastima/"&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt; against violence towards LGBT people.  It was a
very peaceful and somewhat cheerful event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://static.ba.n1info.com/Picture/112125/jpeg/Sequence-01.Still011.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Protesters, source: http://ba.n1info.com/a153795/Vijesti/Vijesti/Odrzan-protest-LGBTI-osoba.html" src="http://static.ba.n1info.com/Picture/112125/jpeg/Sequence-01.Still011.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Protesters, source: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ba.n1info.com/a153795/Vijesti/Vijesti/Odrzan-protest-LGBTI-osoba.html"&gt;http://ba.n1info.com/a153795/Vijesti/Vijesti/Odrzan-protest-LGBTI-osoba.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the protest we went for some coffee and I had the opportunity to meet
interesting people including a German guy who works for the European embassy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon I visited the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://museum.warchildhood.com/"&gt;War Childhood Museum&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a very heart
touching experience, reading the stories of how children were experiencing the
war.  Also, after more than 20 years, marks of the war are still visible
in Sarajevo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we went to the after party of the protest and again I met some
amazing people, amongst others Emina Bošnjak from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://soc.ba/en/about-us/team/"&gt;Sarajevo Open Centre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I had a BlaBlaCar booked for the early afternoon, so we had bearly
enough time to go up to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebević"&gt;Trebević&lt;/a&gt; mountain, enjoy the view and walk the way
down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_mountain_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="View from Trebević" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/sarajevo/sarajevo_mountain_2.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;View from Trebević&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really loved my stay in Sarajevo.  czesiek is an awesome host and I can
highly recommend to stay with him if you are in Sarajevo ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, next stop: Zagreb, Croatia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label" /&gt;&lt;col /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="#id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This was my first BlaBlaCar ride. I can really recommend to travel with it!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After the quite long train ride from Timișoara to Belgrade via Budapest, I
finally arrived in Belgrade around 16:00.  Like most of the time, the first
thing I did was getting some local currency, sitting in a café and figure out
where I can stay.  I chose the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/rs/hostel-white-town.de.html"&gt;Hostel White Town&lt;/a&gt; because it is really close
to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://oosm.org/"&gt;Hacklab Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a great choice!  It's not really a hostel, but more of a
guest house.  And the owner is one of the most lovely persons I've ever met!
She tries hard to make your stay as pleasant as possible and it's also fun to
hang out with her.  For example she provided me with a mobile hotspot so I
could have access to the internet on the go.  I also met a Russian guy who
lives there since a few month.  It was fun to hang out with him and he showed
me some cool places in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly the hackerspace wasn't open during my stay.  But I contacted them on
their mailing list and one of them told me that we could meet the next day in
the afternoon so I can take a look at the hacklab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next day I took a look at the city and then proceeded to the hacklab in
the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/belgrad/belgrad_city.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="View in Belgrade where the Danube and Sava rivers join" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/belgrad/belgrad_city.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;View in Belgrade where the Danube and Sava rivers join&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hacklab is actually located in a former flat and thus contains a nice
kitchen and bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/belgrad/belgrad_main_room.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Main room of the hacklab" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/belgrad/belgrad_main_room.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Main room of the hacklab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space basically consists of the main room which has some working places and
sofas.  There is also a place to do electronics work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/belgrad/belgrad_electronics_work.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Electronics work place" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/belgrad/belgrad_electronics_work.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Electronics work place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have a second room which provides some more working space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/belgrad/belgrad_room_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Second room" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/belgrad/belgrad_room_2.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Second room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting thing in their space is the book scanning machine.  One can use
it to digitize books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/belgrad/belgrad_book_scanning.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Book scanning machine" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/belgrad/belgrad_book_scanning.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Book scanning machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After showing me around we got to talk about what they mainly do in the space.
He told me they have lots of meetups and language training courses.  They
provide these as a kind of free education, because a lot of students who
finished studying can't find a job related to their field and thus try to find
a programming related job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after my rather short visit in both Belgrade and the hacklab, I continued my
travel to Sarajevo!&lt;/p&gt;
</content><category term="tour de hackerspace"></category><category term="hackerspace"></category><category term="travelling"></category></entry><entry><title>Visiting Plan Zero</title><link href="//rnestler.github.io/visiting-plan-zero.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-08T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-05-08T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>rnestler</name></author><id>tag:rnestler.github.io,2017-05-08:/visiting-plan-zero.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p class="first last"&gt;Visiting the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planzero.ro"&gt;Plan Zero&lt;/a&gt; hackerspace&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a quite relaxing train ride, I arrived in Timișoara at 21:30.  After
contacting the hackerspace via email, Mihai, a member of the space, suggested
that he can pick me up from the train station and I can spend the night in the
hackerspace.  After some difficulties finding each other at the train station
we went directly to the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_entry.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Entry to the Plan Zero hackerspace" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_entry.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Entry to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planzero.ro"&gt;Plan Zero&lt;/a&gt; hackerspace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then gave me a short tour around the space, especially showing me their (or
mainly his) awesome collection of fully working retro computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_retro_3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Retro computer collection" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_retro_3.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Retro computer collection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst others they own a C-64, an Amiga, Apple-II clones and a &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_retro_2.jpg"&gt;Mac Classic&lt;/a&gt;.
After the quick show around he just handed me the keys for the space, showed me
the couch and explained me which doors I need to close over night.  I was
impressed by this level of trust they showed me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after hacking a &lt;em&gt;tiny bit&lt;/em&gt; on the C-64 while getting constant attention from
the cat which lives in the space, I went to sleep around 3 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_c64.mp4"&gt;&lt;img alt="Having fun with the C-64" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_c64.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Having fun with the C-64&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I explored the city and met with Mihai in the afternoon.  We then
took a quick look at the art atelier where his wife works.  After that we
returned to the hackerspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like almost every hackerspace Plan Zero also has a main room.  In contrast to
other spaces the main room is more about hanging out and eating than working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_main_room.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Main room" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_main_room.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Main room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next there is a room with electronics equipment 3D printers and work places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_electronics_working_room.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Electronics / working room" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_electronics_working_room.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Electronics / working room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_3d_printers.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="3D printers" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_3d_printers.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;3D printers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While three 3D printers are fully operational, one of the members is building a
forth printer next to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space is also well equipped for most mechanic needs, with a nice workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_work_shop_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Workshop tooling" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_work_shop_2.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Workshop tooling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also similar to other spaces there is a small storage room for random stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_storage.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Storage room" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/plan_zero/plan_zero_storage.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Storage room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I spent some time taking a closer look at the space, taking pictures and
talking to the members, we ordered the classic hackers dinner (pizza).  Although
spending the night at the hackerspace was nice, it didn't have a shower, so I
booked a hostel nearby.  Despite their website saying one can check in until
23:00, when we arrived there, nobody was present.  Luckily Claudiu and Andrei
helped me contacting the owner of the hostel so he could let me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everything related to the hostel was resolved, they showed me some of the
cooler bars in Timișoara, where we had some beer, live music and a fun time
together!  What I learned that night was, that the Romanians party a bit harder
then what I can handle, so I was glad when we ordered a taxi together to get
back to my hostel at 5am ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sleeping in and having some late breakfast I returned to the hackerspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mihai was also at the space and tried to hook up an Amiga with a floppy
emulator which allows to connect USB thumb drives with images on it.  After
trying several USB drives and bricking one due to wrong wiring, he finally got
it working:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When planning for my next destination I realized that traveling through the
Balkan area by train is harder than I thought.  Apparently the direct line from
Timișoara to Belgrade got canceled some time ago (But was still present on the
InterRail map).  So I tried to find a ride on BlaBlaCar which worked, but then
the ride got cancelled some hours before the start because the driver had
problems with his car.  So in order to get to Belgrade I needed to take an 18h
train ride via Budapest.  Well, this at least gave me some time to write this
blog post ;)&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After returning from RustFest I spent one more day in Budapest to pick up my
luggage from the Hackerspace Budapest and to recover a bit from the lack of
sleep during my visit in Kiev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had some trouble contacting the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hackerspace-szeged.org/"&gt;Hackerspace Szeged&lt;/a&gt; and I didn't
bother to book a hostel or anything, I just took the train to Szeged and hoped
for the best.  As it turns out once more, the advantage of not planing anything
at all is, that one can't get disappointed and is open to positive surprises!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I had the pleasure to meet Zsuzsa who studies in Budapast and lives
in Szeged.  Upon hearing about my trip, she spontaneously invited me to stay
with her and Balint in their apartment.  Sometimes it's hard to grasp for me
how incredibly lucky I am to meet all these amazing people during my travel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after sharing some pizza for dinner with them I tried to visit the
Hackerspace Szeged, since they told me they had a lock picking workshop this
evening.  Sadly I arrived to late at their space and their workshop was already
over and they left the space.  I guess this is one of the downsides of not
planing ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I spent the next day taking a look at the wonderful city of Szeged,
including a visit to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szeged_witch_trials"&gt;&amp;quot;Witch Island&amp;quot; area&lt;/a&gt; and the local zoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/szeged/city/szeged_city_5.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Szeged Cathedral" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/szeged/city/szeged_city_5.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Szeged Cathedral&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening I finally managed to pay a short visit to the Hackerspace
Szeged.  They had a follow up of their lock picking workshop of the day before,
so they explained me how to theoretically pick combination locks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/szeged/szeged_lock.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Combination lock for the workshop" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/szeged/szeged_lock.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Combination lock for the workshop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are a young and rather small hackerspace, but active nevertheless!  The
space consist of the classical main room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/szeged/szeged_main_room_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Main room of the Hackerspace Szeged" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/szeged/szeged_main_room_1.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Main room of the Hackerspace Szeged&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a second smaller room which they mostly use as a storage room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/szeged/szeged_second_room.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Main room of the Hackerspace Szeged" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/szeged/szeged_second_room.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Main room of the Hackerspace Szeged&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I already made plans to spend the rest of the evening with Zsuzsa and
Balint, I spent just about 2 hours in their space.  I'd loved to hear more
about the projects they are working on, so maybe I'll return in the future to
visit them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I had an amazing stay in Szeged!  While I'd loved to stay a few more
days,  I was really looking forward to visit Timişoara in Romania!&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I originally planed to fly to Kiev on Friday to visit &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hacklab.kiev.ua/en/"&gt;Hacklab Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; and
attend the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2017.rustfest.eu"&gt;RustFest&lt;/a&gt; workshops the next day.  But as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/rnstlr/status/857902876588486658"&gt;you may heard about&lt;/a&gt;,
I missed my flight due to my silliness.  So I was busy for most of Friday
riding trains, trying to learn a bit of Ukrainian &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, discuss the validity of
my ticket with the train crew, buying additional tickets and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train ride was quite an adventure and I even got to ride the famous
&amp;quot;platzkart&amp;quot; class night train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_train_ride_3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The famous platzkart" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_train_ride_3.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The famous platzkart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't take many pictures during the platzkart train ride, but if you want
the get a better feeling for it just &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=platzkart&amp;amp;atb=v10&amp;amp;iar=images&amp;amp;iax=1&amp;amp;ia=images"&gt;search for pictures&lt;/a&gt;.  I arrived in Kiev
around 11 in the morning (original plan was to arrive at 9) and met with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dns2utf8"&gt;Dns2utf8&lt;/a&gt; at the train station because I arranged to share a hotel room with
him for the duration of RustFest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rustfest"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2017.rustfest.eu"&gt;RustFest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting a long overdue shower, we went to the RustFest workshops.  I was
really happy to meet &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/andrewhobden"&gt;&amp;#64;andrewhobden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/NGC_3572"&gt;thomascovenant (&amp;#64;NGC_3572)&lt;/a&gt;, which
both did an amazing job as part of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2017.rustfest.eu/about/"&gt;RustFest team&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a few hours to late we could still attend the workshops.  I
attended the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/exonum/workshop"&gt;Exonum cryptocurrency workshop&lt;/a&gt; instead of the web development I
originally signed up for.  Since I missed the introduction, I jumped right into
writing Rust code without having any clue how their blockchain implementation
even works.  By the end of the workshop we had some kind of crypto currency
implemented with a little node based web app to create new wallets, add funds
out of nowhere and transfer funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_rustfest_crypto_3.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshots from the webapp" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_rustfest_crypto_3.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Screenshots from the webapp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a bug in the implementation, where if one transferred funds from a
wallet to itself it would just increase the balance of this wallet!  The fix
was as simple as adding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;receiver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(())&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inside a function.  I didn't have time to figure out why the bug happened
exactly, since all the function does is decrement on the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sender&lt;/tt&gt; and
increment on the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;receiver&lt;/tt&gt;, which should lead to an equal final balance if
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sender == receiver&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the workshop we formed a little group of Rustaceans and had a great time
taking a look at the city!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_7.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="View over parts of Kiev" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_7.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;View over parts of Kiev&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some more images:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_1.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_2.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_5.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_5.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_6.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_7.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_7.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_8.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_8.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_9.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_9.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_10.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/city/kiev_city_10.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we found a wonderful place for dinner and later met with some
other Rustaceans to spend some time in a bar which &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik"&gt;Steve Klabnik&lt;/a&gt; suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning it was time for a quite diverse range of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2017.rustfest.eu/talks/"&gt;talks&lt;/a&gt;.  I
particularly enjoyed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;'Open' as in 'Welcoming': Facilitating Contributions&amp;quot; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Manishearth"&gt;Manish
Goregaokar&lt;/a&gt; because it basically summarized what RustFest is all about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;The Illustrated Adventure Survival Guide for New Rustaceans&amp;quot; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/_lbaillie"&gt;Liz
Baillie&lt;/a&gt; as it was super entertaining with cute images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Making a game in Rust&amp;quot; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lislis"&gt;lislis&lt;/a&gt; because I also tried to create a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coredump-ch/rpsrtsrs"&gt;game
with Rust&lt;/a&gt; (still not finished)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the day I had the pleasure to met the brilliant author of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://edunham.net/2016/04/11/plushie_rustacean_pattern.html"&gt;Plushie
Rustacean Pattern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/qedunham"&gt;E Dunham&lt;/a&gt;.  She was impressed, that my girlfriend
actually managed to create a Plushie Ferris from her description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://twitter.com/NGC_3572/status/852546171440685056"&gt;&lt;img alt="My Plushie Ferris" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/ferris.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;My Plushie Ferris, picture taken by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/NGC_3572"&gt;thomascovenant (&amp;#64;NGC_3572)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we had a great time during the after party.  Getting to know the
community from this very relaxed and personal side was absolutely awesome!  I
talked to quite a few people and learned lots of stuff.  I also talked to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/ag_dubs"&gt;Ashley Williams&lt;/a&gt; about how to best teach kids programming and other stuff,
since we &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coredump.ch/2014/11/10/ferienpass-im-hackerspace/"&gt;do that&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coredump.ch/2016/11/01/ferienpass-2016/"&gt;our hackerspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://twitter.com/NGC_3572/status/858773710869803008"&gt;&lt;img alt="Me and some other Rustaceans" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_rustaceans.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Me and some other Rustaceans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like last year, RustFest was super amazing!  It's so awesome to meet this
incredible community!  I'm really looking forward to the next RustFest this
fall in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rustfest.ch/"&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="visiting-hacklab-kyiv"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visiting Hacklab Kyiv&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I met with Dmitriy, who I met at RustFest, to get lunch together.
Since he speaks Russian it was quite easy for him to chat with the locals and
find us a good place to get some Ukrainian food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arranged with Anastasia from the Hacklab Kyiv that I could couch surf at
their place.  Since I wanted to meet with Anastasia to drop off my luggage, I
agreed with Dimitry to split and see each other again in the hackerspace.
Anastasia and her partner Sasha are some of the most lovely people I've ever
met!  They showed me around the city, helped me with public transport and it
was always fun to hang out with them.  So I was happy I brought some Swiss
chocolate with me which I could give them as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dropping my luggage we went to the hackerspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_entry.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Entry to the HackLab  Kyiv" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_entry.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Entry to the HackLab  Kyiv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their hackerspace consist mostly of people which are interested in mechanical
engineering and electronics.  Due to that they own some awesome equippment such
as multiple CNC machines, 3D printers, compressors and lots of other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_cnc.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="CNC mill" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_cnc.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;CNC mill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_big_cnc.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Even bigger CNC mill" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_big_cnc.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Even bigger CNC mill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_3d_printers.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="3D printers" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_3d_printers.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;3D printers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They created quite some awesome stuff with their 3D printer, including molds to
create metallic stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_3d_prints.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Awesome stuff they created with the 3D printers" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_3d_prints.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Awesome stuff they created with the 3D printers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most hackerspaces they also feature a big main working room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_main_room_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Main room" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_main_room_2.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Main room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally to that they feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A workshop&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a class="first last reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_workshop.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_workshop.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A storage room&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Chemistry lab&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a class="first last reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_chemistry.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_chemistry.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A soldering place&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a class="first last reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_soldering.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_soldering.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A Tesla coil&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a class="first last reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_tesla_coil.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_tesla_coil.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a room next to the hackerspace there is a studio for people working with
ceramics.  They told me that they share some tools and generally support each
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_ceramics_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ceramics studio" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/kiev/kiev_ceramics_2.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Ceramics studio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they had shown me around and I talked to most of them for some time, some
of us went to get dinner together. We spent a considerable amount of time
discussing various things, amongst others the problem that a lot of spaces
share: The founders are basically the only ones taking care of everything in
regard to organizing the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have this problem as well in our space and tried to solve it, by actively
splitting responsibilities for various tasks.  An example is: For a long time
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dbrgn"&gt;Danilo Bargen&lt;/a&gt;, our formal president, was responsible for every single IT
infrastructure task at coredump.  So I encouraged him to show me how to manage
our servers, update services and so on.  This not only to let him have more
time at hand, but also to remove a single point of failure in our organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I spent some time trying to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/rnstlr/status/859351392871428097"&gt;repair my Fairphone&lt;/a&gt;.  At first it
seemed to work perfectly, but after some time it did again refuse to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My flight back was on 16:45. This time I actually was able to catch it, but if
you want to hear a funny story on how I almost missed it again, feel free to DM
me on Twitter ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely enjoyed my stay in Kiev and my visit to Hacklab Kyiv.  I'd loved
to stay a few more days, but my travel continued back to Budapest and then
further on to Szeged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label" /&gt;&lt;col /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="#id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;It always amazes me how much communication is possible with just &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/ukrainian.php"&gt;some sentences&lt;/a&gt;, lots of smiling, gestures and some pictures from a mobile phone.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When arriving in Budapest in the afternoon, I noticed that the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hsbp.org/"&gt;Hackerspace
Budapest&lt;/a&gt; was still closed, so I used the time to organize my flight to Kiev
for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2017.rustfest.eu"&gt;RustFest&lt;/a&gt; and book a hotel close to the airport.  As it turned out this
was a bit unnecessary, but more about that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I couldn't figure out where the Hackerspace Budapest had its IRC channel
(turns out it is &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;#hspbp&lt;/tt&gt; on IRCnet. One can connect to it using
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;open.ircnet.net&lt;/tt&gt;), I just waited till the state on their website turned to
&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding their hackerspace was a lot harder then I thought!  They give you the
street name and number on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hackerspace_Budapest"&gt;hackerspace wiki&lt;/a&gt;, but when I arrived at this
street I found a three floor building with various flats.  I looked around
there and asked a plumber which was working there, if he knew about a
hackerspace.  He couldn't help me, but confirmed that I'm in the correct
building according to the street name and number.  So I continued to look
around, which led to some neighbours getting suspicious about me.  I had a
rather strange conversation with one of them who apparently couldn't speak any
English.  After trying to help me for a while he showed me out.  When I was
just walking away I noticed a small door about a meter away from the entry to
the building:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Entry to the Hackerspace Budapest" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/budapest/budapest_entry.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Entry to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hsbp.org/"&gt;Hackerspace Budapest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the Club Mate crates, reassured me that this &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be the Hackerspace I
was looking for!  So I entered  and told them my story about searching for
their hackerspace.  When we finished laughing, they showed me around in their
space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the classical main working room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Main working room" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/budapest/budapest_main_working_area.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Main working room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the main working room there is a small &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotope"&gt;biotope&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_wall"&gt;green wall&lt;/a&gt; /
biological experiment setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="biotope / green wall in the main room" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/budapest/budapest_biotope.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;biotope / green wall in the main room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside there lives an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt; (named Haxolotl) which, so they told me, forms
a stable ecosystem together with the plants.  Apparently the excretion from the
axolotl produce all the minerals the plants need to grow.  So they simply pump
the water where the axolotl resides to the top and let it flow down.  The only
thing they need to do is to feed the axolotl with worms every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Axolotl" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/budapest/budapest_axolotl_0.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Axolotl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have built a mechanism to avoid over feeding the axolotl:  Whenever
one feeds it, you also press a button which will then change its color from
green to red.  This will remain like that until the next feeding time were it
will turn green again.  I found this whole thing quite amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next there is their 3D-printer and electronics lab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="3D printer and electronics lab" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/budapest/budapest_3d_printer.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;3D printer and electronics lab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a rather small hackerspace, comparable to coredump, they didn't have a
laser cutter, since they can't afford it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space also features a kitchen and restrooms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Kitchen and door to the restrooms" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/budapest/budapest_kitchen.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Kitchen and door to the restrooms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special thing I found in their space is the so called &amp;quot;loot area&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Loot area" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/budapest/budapest_loot_area.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Loot area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The members just put stuff there either if they have no use for it or as a gift
for the other members, mostly in the form of food and drinks.  One can loot the
area by just taking the things for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also told to me about the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hsbp.org/camppp7e1"&gt;Camp++&lt;/a&gt; they are organizing every year, which
sounded a bit like a smaller version of the Chaos Communication Camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I spent mostly taking a look at Budapest, which is quite an
amazing city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wanted to travel only with cabin baggage to Kiev, I agreed with the
space, that I can store my suitcase in their room and pick it up when I return
from Kiev.  So I arrived in the evening to store my suitcase.  Since I and the
only hacker present didn't have any dinner yet, we decided to cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Cooking in the hackerspace" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/budapest/budapest_cooking.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Cooking in the hackerspace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after eating together and talking for a bit, I decided to go to the Hotel
early, since I had the flight to Kiev in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly I forgot, that I still had my passport in my suitcase in the hackerspace
which I noticed when I was already at the airport.  I tried to travel to Kiev
with just my ID card, but when boarding they told me this isn't possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while writing this post I'm on a 18 hour train ride to Kiev which is still
faster than taking the next flight which would be on Saturday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed my visit in the Hackerspace Budapest and will visit them
shortly again when I return from Kiev on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I hit the bars a bit too hard with some of the guys and gals of brmlab, I
had a bit of a hard time getting up in the morning.  Anyway, I quite enjoyed
relaxing a bit in the train while travelling to Bratislava.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="visiting-progressbar"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visiting Progressbar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of the hackerspace, Andrew, described me pretty well on IRC how to get
to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.progressbar.sk/"&gt;Progressbar&lt;/a&gt; from the train station, while also getting quite a nice
look at Bratislava at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Entry to the Progressbar" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/progressbar/progressbar_entry.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Entry to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.progressbar.sk/"&gt;Progressbar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arriving he gave me a tour around the space and then continued to repair
his bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space consists of a nice big main working / presentation / hang-out room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Progressbar main room" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/progressbar/progressbar_main_room.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.progressbar.sk/"&gt;Progressbar&lt;/a&gt; main room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a co-working / office room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Progressbar co-working room" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/progressbar/progressbar_co_working_space_2.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.progressbar.sk/"&gt;Progressbar&lt;/a&gt; co-working room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the next room there's the kitchen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Progressbar kitchen" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/progressbar/progressbar_kitchen_2.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.progressbar.sk/"&gt;Progressbar&lt;/a&gt; kitchen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opposite site of the space there is also a room with an electronic lab
and some tooling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Progressbar electronic lab" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/progressbar/progressbar_electronic_lab.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.progressbar.sk/"&gt;Progressbar&lt;/a&gt; electronic lab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the space also has some awesome decorations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Progressbar animated LED bar" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/progressbar/progressbar_decoration.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.progressbar.sk/"&gt;Progressbar&lt;/a&gt; animated LED bar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Andrew finished fixing his bike, we went to have dinner.  He then
continued to show me a bit of Bratislava and the local beer culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Outside of Progressbar in the old town" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/progressbar/progressbar_outside.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Outside of Progressbar in the old town&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I took a look at the city, which is rather small but pretty.  In
the evening I attended the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://scuttlebot.io/"&gt;scuttlebutt&lt;/a&gt; workshop in Progressbar.  Scuttlebutt
is some kind of distributed cryptographically signed message board, where every
identity has a append only feed.  I shortly tested the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork"&gt;patchwork&lt;/a&gt; scuttlebutt
application.  For me it felt a bit like a distributed Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a few of the guys there are also Rustaceans we also talked about that,
and they told me that their door lock implementation runs with Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Progressbar door lock system" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/progressbar/progressbar_door_lock_system.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Progressbar door lock system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that evening we started to watch some 64k demos, of course including the
two I know of which are written in Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=69658"&gt;Engage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWwNgVwQG1A"&gt;Logicoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="64k demo time with animated LED bar on the left" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/progressbar/progressbar_demo_time.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;64k demo time with animated LED bar on the left&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed my time in Progressbar and their hospitality was amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="visiting-metalab-in-vienna"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visiting Metalab in Vienna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I actually spent in Vienna, which is just a 1h train ride away,
were I visited &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://metalab.at/"&gt;Metalab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space is located centrally close to the &amp;quot;Rathaus&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Metalab entry" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/metalab/metalab_entry.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Metalab entry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just on arrival the space was actually empty (but open), because most of the
members were having dinner on the outside.  Just moments after that, two
members showed up and I asked them for a tour.  But one can't get a tour
without drinking some Mate!  So I bought a Flora Power from them after using
their self built &amp;quot;Kassomat&amp;quot; to get some coins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Metalab Kassomat" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/metalab/metalab_kassomat.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Metalab Kassomat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that rather impressive start they continued to show me the rest of the
space:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Metalab 3D printers" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/metalab/metalab_3d_printer.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Metalab 3D printers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Metalab almost obligatory laser cutter and electronic lab" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/metalab/metalab_laser_cutter_el_lab.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Metalab almost obligatory laser cutter and electronic lab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really impressed me was there workshop, containing a decent CNC machine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Metalab CNC" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/metalab/metalab_cnc.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Metalab CNC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space actually also includes a big main room, a kitchen, a lounge and some
storage and server rooms.  Sadly I didn't take any pictures of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While getting rid of my processed Flora Power after the tour, I noticed the
rather beautiful decorations they have in their restrooms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Metalab restroom decoration" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/metalab/metalab_toilet_decoration.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Metalab restroom decoration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is even a little screen with a few buttons to play a video game, while
having a longer session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had only a few hours to spend there, I just briefly attended their
member meeting, were they discussed some Metalab related issues.  The rest of
the time I mostly spent talking to some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in Vienna I definitely recommend to check out Metalab, since it is a
quite amazing Hackerspace!  I'd loved to spend more time there, but again the
next chapter of my &amp;quot;Tour de Hackerspace&amp;quot; was calling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a quite pleasant night train ride I arrived around 7am in Prague.  This
left me with enough time to book my hotel and get to know the city a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I booked the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://osmand.net/go?lat=50.090122&amp;amp;lon=14.437044&amp;amp;z=18"&gt;A plus Hostel&lt;/a&gt; close to the Florenc metro station which is in
the intersection of two metro lines, giving me a great starting point to
explore the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://brmlab.cz/"&gt;brmlab&lt;/a&gt; website showed, that the space is apparently open, I
decided to take a look at it quite early in the day.  I had some trouble
actually finding the space, so I advice you to use their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://brmlab.cz/place"&gt;well written
description&lt;/a&gt; on how to find their space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Entry to the brmlab" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_entry.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Entry to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://brmlab.cz/"&gt;brmlab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space features some of the usual stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;A big main working room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_main_room.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="brmlab main working room" class="align-center" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_main_room.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;A small server room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_server_room.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="brmlab server room" class="align-center" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_server_room.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;A workshop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_workshop.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="brmlab workshop" class="align-center" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_workshop.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what really sets their hackerspace apart from others is that it features a
chemistry and a bio lab!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Parts of the bio lab with a microscope" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_micro_scope.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Parts of the bio lab with a microscope&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did actually take a look at a small silicon wafer from unknown origin the
same evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Looking at a silicon wafer through the microscope" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_micro_scope_silicon.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Looking at a silicon wafer through the microscope&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the bio lab there is also the relax zone / silent room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Relax zone with awesome graffiti" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_silent_room.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Relax zone with awesome graffiti!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite stunning is their high voltage lab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="brmlab high voltage lab" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_high_voltage_lab.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;brmlab high voltage lab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It features some quite huge &lt;a class="reference external" href="images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_high_voltage_lab_2.jpg"&gt;Tesla coils&lt;/a&gt; and other high voltage equipment such
as high voltage capacitors, transformers or high voltage measurement systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also really impressive is the bitcoin ATM they have!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Bitcoin ATM" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_bitcoin_atm.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Bitcoin ATM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't resist and &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_bitcoin_transaction.jpg"&gt;bought myself 6 mBTC&lt;/a&gt; immediately.  They told me that
this is the first prototype of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.generalbytes.com/first-bitcoin-atm-deployed/"&gt;General Bytes bitcoin ATM&lt;/a&gt;.  It was
installed in their space so they could test it.  During testing they found and
reported two security issues, which then could be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most hackerspaces they also have some awesome decorations, in this case a
wall paneled with motherboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Wall of motherboards" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_motherboards.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Wall of motherboards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The also own an &lt;a class="reference external" href="images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_ibm.jpg"&gt;IBM AS/400 system&lt;/a&gt; with a fitting hardware terminal which
gives one some possibilities to discover a mainframe style system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Terminal connected to the IBM AS/400" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_ibm_terminal.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Terminal connected to the IBM AS/400&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was real fun interacting with this machine!  You can find more information
about it on their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://brmlab.cz/project/as400/start"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all my Prague and brmlab experience was really amazing! The city is very
beautiful (albeit a bit crowed with tourists) and I enjoyed hanging out with a
few of the brmlab hackers the other night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Overview of Prague" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/brmlab/brmlab_prague.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since the 3G connection during the train ride was exceptionally bad, I had
trouble with my credit card and the train didn't have electric plugs, I ran out
of battery before I could finish booking a hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first thing I did when arriving in Kraków was looking for the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackerspace-krk.pl/"&gt;Hackerspace Kraków&lt;/a&gt;.  Luckily it's very close to the main train station and
Wiktor, one of the members which talked to me on IRC, was waiting outside to
show me in!  This made me feel very welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Entry to the Hackerspace Kraków" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/krakow/krakow_entry_1.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Entry to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackerspace-krk.pl/"&gt;Hackerspace Kraków&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After charging my devices, talking to my credit card company and booking my
hotel, he showed me around.  They've actually just moved in a few month ago and
the space isn't yet open for public, so they told me.  They are still thinking
about ideas on how to decorate the space.  I proposed to make the entry look
like a submarine since the corridor is very narrow and rounded on the top.  I'm
looking forward to see what they will do with the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space mainly consist of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/krakow/krakow_electronic_lab.jpg"&gt;electronic lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/krakow/krakow_computer_room.jpg"&gt;computer / presentation room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/krakow/krakow_work_shop.jpg"&gt;workshop room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the workshop they actually built the ventilation system themself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Workshop ventilation system" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/krakow/krakow_work_shop_ventilation.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Workshop ventilation system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And during my visit they actually built a controller board to be able to
regulate the speed of the ventilation system.  Was awesome to watch them
getting busy until 1 or 2am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Workshop ventilation controller" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/krakow/krakow_work_shop_ventilation_controlled.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Workshop ventilation with freshly built controller on the bottom right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also told me about some past and present projects.  In the past they
helped build the lightening system for the Galeria Krakowska, which is a big
shopping mall close to the main train station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Galeria Krakowska lightening system" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/krakow/krakow_galeria.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Galeria Krakowska lightening system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green LED wall on the picture can actually change color and also show
different animations and effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another project they are working on is tracking and collecting &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosonde"&gt;radiosondes&lt;/a&gt;.
This probes are used for weather related analysis and are started with weather
balloons by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://radiosonde.eu/RS00-D/RS02C-D.html"&gt;weather stations&lt;/a&gt; all around Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Captured radiosondes" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/krakow/krakow_radio_sonde_0.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Captured radiosondes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of their member created a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/teeed/dxlaprs/"&gt;Docker image&lt;/a&gt; which contains various software
related to tracking the radiosondes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Setup used to track radiosondes" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/krakow/krakow_radio_sonde_tracking.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Setup used to track radiosondes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Tracking coverage achieved with the setup above" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/krakow/krakow_radio_sonde_coverage.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Tracking coverage achieved with the setup above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I took myself quite some time to have a look at the city (Which is
amazing, I can definitely recommend a visit to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://osmand.net/go?lat=50.05451&amp;amp;lon=19.936409&amp;amp;z=17"&gt;Wawel Castle&lt;/a&gt; and the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://osmand.net/go?lat=50.062&amp;amp;lon=19.937761&amp;amp;z=19"&gt;underground museum&lt;/a&gt;), I only showed up at the hackerspace for a quick goodbye
the other day.  But I really enjoyed my stay their nevertheless!&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was warned on IRC that the activity would be rather low in the Warsaw
Hackerspace Due to being Easter.  So when I arrived in Warsaw I just monitored
their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://at.hackerspace.pl/"&gt;member tracking site&lt;/a&gt; from time to time until it showed some people
being present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entry to the space was a bit hard to find, because it's in the basement.
But they later told me, that they will move their space to a different location
next month anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Entry to the Warsaw Hackerspace" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/warsaw/warsaw_entry.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Entry to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.hackerspace.pl/"&gt;Warsaw Hackerspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On arrival they showed me around their hackerspace.  Of course they have a
laser-cutter &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; and some 3D printers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Laser cutter and 3D printers" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/warsaw/warsaw_laser_cutter.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Laser cutter and 3D printers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told, that the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.hackerspace.pl/"&gt;Warsaw Hackerspace&lt;/a&gt; has around 100 members consisting of
a good mix of computer science, electronic engineering, mechanical engineering
and other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really impressed me was the equipment in their work shop! They have
amongst other stuff a CNC mill and &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/warsaw/warsaw_work_show_cnc_lathe.jpg"&gt;lathe&lt;/a&gt;,  which they control using
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://linuxcnc.org/"&gt;linuxcnc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="CNC mill" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/warsaw/warsaw_work_shop_cnc.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;CNC mill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have equipment to produce their own PCBs, using a cheap UV nail
curing lamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="PCB manufactoring equipment" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/warsaw/warsaw_pcb_manufactoring.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;PCB manufactoring equipment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also impressive was their retro computing collection! Amongst other devices
they own a VT520 terminal which they use to print the messages posted on IRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="VT520 terminal" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/warsaw/warsaw_vt520.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;VT520 terminal used to print IRC messages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked for a beverage, they showed me there vending machine, which is
broken and can't accept coins anymore.  But stand back, they hacked it to hook
up with their internal payment system!  It's apparently as simple as hooking up
a Raspberry Pi to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidrop_bus#MDB_in_Vending_Machines"&gt;Multidrop bus&lt;/a&gt; to control the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Hacked vending machine" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/warsaw/warsaw_vending_machine.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Hacked vending machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening I had an awesome debugging session with one of their
members who tried to intercept C library calls (This was part of an university
assignment).  Since I never looked into how dynamic linking works in Linux,
this was very interesting for me!  Maybe I'll write a separate blog post about
that if I find time to dig a bit deeper into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the time I spent with this awesome and very active
hackerspace! My next stop will be Hackerspace Kraków!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label" /&gt;&lt;col /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="#id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;We should really get a laser-cutter for coredump. This will be the first thing I will do when I return!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After an exhausting train ride from Amsterdam to Berlin which started at 20.25
and ended at 5.33 the next day, I discovered that I couldn't get a train the
same day to Warsaw since they were all fully booked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my plans changed a bit and I would stay a full day in Berlin which was nice
in some way because it meant I could visit &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.c-base.org/"&gt;c-base&lt;/a&gt; in the evening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I discovered by coincidence that a few friends of mine from Switzerland
were staying in Berlin this weekend and I could hang out with them during the
day.  I also met with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/andrewhobden"&gt;&amp;#64;andrewhobden&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin, whom I met at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2016.rustfest.eu/"&gt;RustFest
2016&lt;/a&gt; last year.  This was a very awesome coincidence, since we didn't plan
any of it and we just ended up meeting in Berlin and having a great time
together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after dinner we split again and I headed towards c-base.  c-base is located
near the &amp;quot;Jannowitzbrücke&amp;quot; and thus very easily reachable with public
transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Entry to the c-base" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/cbase/cbase_entry.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Entry to the c-base&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When entering c-base I was amazed because of all the very nicely done
decoration they have inside which leads to a great atmosphere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="The Mate light" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/cbase/cbase_mate_light.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The Mate light inside c-base&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The members in the space were a bit busy because they had their &amp;quot;circle&amp;quot;
meeting.  So I just started talking to the members not attending the meeting
and somehow got pretty absorbed giving one of them a rather in depth
introduction to basic embedded development using amongst other things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.arduino.cc/"&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/"&gt;avrdude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openocd.org/"&gt;openocd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.segger.com/jlink-debug-probes.html"&gt;J-Link&lt;/a&gt; debuggers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kicad-pcb.org/"&gt;KiCad&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://librepcb.org/"&gt;LibrePCB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate"&gt;Bus Pirate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.i2c-bus.org/"&gt;I2C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This list serves primarily as a reference for him in case he forgot to
bookmark them ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was still very tired from the lack of sleep during the train ride from
Amsterdam to Berlin I originally planed to stay no longer as midnight.  But
since I got really busy and was invited to be given a show around the crashed
space station around 1am, I stayed until 2:30am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guided tour through the spaceship was pretty awesome, thanks again to my
guide!  Since I didn't really take any pictures I recommend you to visit
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.c-base.org/"&gt;c-base&lt;/a&gt; by yourself if you're around Berlin next time!&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Getting a place to stay in Amsterdam was harder then I thought due to the fact,
that a lot of hotels and hostels where fully or almost fully booked!  I still
got a room after a bit of hassle (Thanks to this booking sites &amp;quot;only two rooms
left, book them now!&amp;quot;, I accidentally booked &amp;quot;1 bed in the women sleeping
room&amp;quot;, silly me) in the &amp;quot;WOW Amsterdam&amp;quot; hostel. It's not that close to the
center, but reachable with either bus or the metro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the train ride from Düsseldorf and a bus ride to my hostel I took the
metro to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://technologia-incognita.nl/"&gt;Technologia Incognita&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space features the usual stuff with a kitchen, a &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/techinc/techinc_vending_machine_laser_cutter.jpg"&gt;laser-cutter&lt;/a&gt; (if you
look closely you will see they sell the Diplomatic Passport in their vending
machine on the left), a work shop and of course some &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/techinc/techinc_LED_ball.jpg"&gt;awesome decoration&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Animated LED fire place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the luck to arrive when they had their visiting day, so lots of people
where around.  Also sine the next day was the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conference.hitb.org/"&gt;Hack in the Box&lt;/a&gt; conference
some attendees of this conference where there as well.  I even met some guys
from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nycresistor.com/"&gt;NYC Resistor&lt;/a&gt; which invited me to have a look at their hackerspace
next time I'm in New York (which will be around June).  They told me about a
project where they create almost impossible to solve &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://trmm.net/Platonic_puzzle"&gt;puzzles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also met &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sasj.nl/"&gt;Saskia Freeke&lt;/a&gt; who creates amazing digital art!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Example of Saskias art" src="http://www.sasj.nl/W14/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/160518.gif" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Example of Saskias creative programming / digital art&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has a project where she creates similar work every single day since 2015!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a cheese, sausage and beer tasting on the same evening which I,
as a Swiss guy, definitely approve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="cheese tasting" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/techinc/techinc_cheese_tasting.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Cheese and sausage tasting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I spontaneously attended the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://conference.hitb.org/"&gt;Hack in the Box&lt;/a&gt; conference where
hackerspaces from the Netherlands also had booths.  I really enjoyed &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://toool.us/"&gt;Toools&lt;/a&gt;
lock-picking booth and the talk of Jos Weyers &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2017ams/sessions/most-impressive-a-guide-to-key-impressioning-attacks/"&gt;Most Impressive: A Guide to Key
Impressioning Attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I really enjoyed my stay in Amsterdam and with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://technologia-incognita.nl/"&gt;Technologia Incognita&lt;/a&gt;
and almost replanned my trip to spend a few more days there, I decided to stick
with my plan for once and travel to Warsaw via Berlin, with a short stop to
visit c-base.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While my original &amp;quot;plan&amp;quot; involved traveling directly to Amsterdam from
Stuttgart, the shackspace guys suggested to visit chaosdorf in Düsseldorf,
since it is halfway to Amsterdam anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After asking if anybody will be present on their IRC channel #chaosdorf, I
decided to stay two days in Düsseldorf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaosdorf is awesomely close, just a 20min foot-walk, to the Düsseldorf main
station!  Also quite close is the Hostel A&amp;amp;O where I could stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="chaosdorf location" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_location.png" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.217974999999996&amp;amp;lon=6.788995&amp;amp;zoom=16&amp;amp;layers=M&amp;amp;mlat=51.21656&amp;amp;mlon=6.78347"&gt;chaosdorf location&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the central location and their prominent front door, they have some
random strangers walking in from time to time, which is pretty awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="chaosdorf entrance" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_entrance.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;chaosdorf entrance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 130 members they have, the rooms is already getting small, but is with
its 160m² still huge compared to coredump!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="main chaosdorf room" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_main_room_1.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;main chaosdorf room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their space features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A laptop lounge with presentation screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_main_room_0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chaosdorf laptop lounge" class="align-center" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_main_room_0.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A kitchen (with a nice hack for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_kitchen_hack.jpg"&gt;hood ventilator light&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_kitchen.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chaosdorf kitchen" class="align-center" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_kitchen.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A laser cutter and 3D printers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_laser_cutter.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chaosdorf laser cutter / 3D printer" class="align-center" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_laser_cutter.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A combined smoking, TV and workshop room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_work_shop.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="chaosdorf work shop" class="align-center" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/chaosdorf/chaosdorf_work_shop.jpg" style="width: 10%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to shackspace some members in chaosdorf also cook dinner for the group
and I could join them on Tuesday evening.  Having a nice kitchen in your space
seems to pay off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to visiting in the midst of the week and not during the weekend, I couldn't
experience the full chaosdorf experience.  I would love to stay until Friday to
experience the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.chaosdorf.de/Freitagsfoo"&gt;Freitagsfoo&lt;/a&gt;, but Amsterdam is calling!&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I arrived at Stuttgart at 5 pm.  During the train ride I asked on the
#shackspace IRC channel if somebody could recommend a place to stay.  All they
told me was I should avoid the &amp;quot;Ambiente&amp;quot;.  So I booked a hotel room close to
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://shack.space"&gt;shackspace&lt;/a&gt; which is 15 minutes from the main train station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Me and Ferris arriving in Stuttgart" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/shackspace/arrival_stuttgart.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Me and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rustacean.net/"&gt;Ferris&lt;/a&gt; arriving in Stuttgart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after arriving at the hotel I went to the shackspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Entry to the shackspace" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/shackspace/shack_entry.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Entry to the shackspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the luck that they were giving a tour to some visitors just when I
arrived, so I could join them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from the rather small hackerspace &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://coredump.ch"&gt;coredump&lt;/a&gt; from Switzerland,
shackspace is huge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="shackspace IT infrastructure" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/shackspace/shack_it.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;shackspace IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have around 400m² of room in their space, given them the possibility to have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A kitchen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A big main working room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A machine room with &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/shackspace/shack_laser_cutter.jpg"&gt;laser-cutter&lt;/a&gt;, 3D-printer, ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/shackspace/shack_work_shop.jpg"&gt;work shop&lt;/a&gt; with drilling machines, saws etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A silent room, mainly used by student for learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/shackspace/shack_conference_room.jpg"&gt;conference room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/shackspace/shack_roof.jpg"&gt;Amateur radio station&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a class="reference external" href="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/shackspace/shack_view.jpg"&gt;antennas&lt;/a&gt; on the roof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around 200 members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like every hackerspace they have lots of beautiful installations arround, like
a Back to the Future themed clock which also shows the founding date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="shackspace founding date" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/shackspace/shack_founding_date.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Back to the Future themed clock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have a beautiful installation showing the open status of various
hackerspaces, gathered via the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://spacedirectory.org/"&gt;SpaceAPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="SpaceAPI status wall" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/shackspace/shack_spaceapi_status.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;SpaceAPI status wall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a member of the space was preparing food for dinner, they invited me
spontaneously to join them! This was awesome, since it meant spending more time
hacking and less searching for food ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I joined the conference room, discussing ideas for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;Space Apps
Challenge 2017&lt;/a&gt; for which the shakspace hosts a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/stuttgart/"&gt;hackathon&lt;/a&gt;.  Last year they
came up with a project to optimize the growth of plants with machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center" style="width: 80%"&gt;
&lt;img alt="shackspace plant experiment" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/shackspace/shack_space_apps_2016.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;shackspace plant experiment for Space Apps Challenge 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed my stay at shackspace! It's a great hackerspace with lots of
creative and technically gifted people hacking on awesome projects.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I start what I call my &amp;quot;Tour de Hackerspace&amp;quot;! I'll be travelling around
Europe and visit various &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/"&gt;hackerspaces&lt;/a&gt; on the way.  To keep travel costs at a
reasonable level, I bought an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.interrail.eu/en"&gt;InterRail&lt;/a&gt; ticket, which allows flexible
travelling by train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Map of Europe from https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Europe" class="align-center" src="/images/tour_de_hackerspace/map_europe.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I'm not the kind of person which is great at planing, this will be more
or less a spontaneous adventure.  I contacted some hackerspaces upfront and
received some great and welcoming responses, especially from the Eastern part
of Europe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first location will be the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://shack.space/"&gt;shackerspace&lt;/a&gt; in Stuttgart, Germany.  After that
I plan to visit a hackerspace in Amsterdam, then travelling a bit in the east
(Czech Republic, Poland, ...) and probably attend the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2017.rustfest.eu/"&gt;RustFest 2017&lt;/a&gt; in Kyiv,
Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to my definitely not definitive plan I will then travel southwards
visiting Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia,
... before returning to Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really looking forward to meet lots of amazing people and see how they live
and hack around Europe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to write a blog post about every hackerspace I visit on my journey,
so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For a long time I have been using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SLiM"&gt;SLiM&lt;/a&gt; as my display manager on ArchLinux.
It worked quite well for me, but is unmaintained since at least 3 years. Also
according to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SLiM"&gt;ArchLinux WiKi&lt;/a&gt; there are issues regarding to systemd
compatibility. Also the Linux desktop is headed towards Wayland so I need a
display manager which can start Wayland sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my choice fell on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/LightDM/"&gt;LightDM&lt;/a&gt;, which should &amp;quot;support different display
technologies (X, Mir, Wayland, ...)&amp;quot; according to their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing it on ArchLinux is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo pacman -S lightdm-gtk-greeter
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we need to deactivate SLiM and activate LightDM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo systemctl disable slim.service
sudo systemctl &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt; lightdm.service
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To switch without a reboot one needs to logout from the X-session, switch to a
TTY with Ctrl-Alt-1 and stop SLiM and start LightDM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo systemctl stop slim.service
sudo systemctl start lightdm.service
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I could login just to notice that my &lt;cite&gt;~/.xinitrc&lt;/cite&gt; wasn't getting
executed, so my helper tools like nm-applet weren't running. Since I already
solved that issue under &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rnestler.github.io/setting-up-the-awesome-window-manager-in-ubuntu-1604.html"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, I was a bit surprised that I need to solve
it differently under ArchLinux according to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LightDM#Migrating_from_SLiM"&gt;the WiKi&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;mv ~/.xinitrc ~/.xprofile
vim ~/.xprofile &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# remove the &amp;quot;exec awesome&amp;quot; line&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I enjoy a working X-Session with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://awesomewm.org/"&gt;awesome window manager&lt;/a&gt; again,
while looking forward to a Wayland based desktop, maybe running the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Immington-Industries/way-cooler"&gt;Way
Cooler&lt;/a&gt; window manager!&lt;/p&gt;
